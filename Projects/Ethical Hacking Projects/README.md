# Vulnerable Machines

This project contains the write-ups of some HackTheBox machines.
I assume that you have a [HackTheBox](www.hackthebox.eu) account and have everything else set up.

Metasploit terms that may not make sense and their clarifications:

- RHOST/RHOSTS : The IP address of your victim machine on HTB

- LHOST : The IP address of your attacker machine

- LPORT : A local port number on your machine of your choosing that is open and unoccupied

Anything else carries its usual meaning.

It is highly recommended that you use a Kali Linux machine as most of the pentesting tools come pre-installed. Otherwise, you will have to install them on your machine manually.
